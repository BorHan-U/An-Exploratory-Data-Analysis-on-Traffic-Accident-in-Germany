##### Project_RSE_824909

This project is to analyze traffic accident and trends in germeny. In this notebook, I will be analyzing a dataset containing information about road accidents between the years 2008 and 2022 in different scenarios such acccident type and location type, etc.. The dataset contains the following columns you must accounted:
    
  - Year                
  - Persons killed      
  - Seriously injured   
  - Slightly injured    
  - Kind of accident    
  - Area type           

With these data, I will conduct data analysis and data visualization to make the data easier to understnd, 
and extract meaningfull insighst from the data.

In this project, with necessary data processing and data exploration, I will be answering following research questions as well:

1. During the crossing car, which year did most death cases occur in inner town?
2. What is the main type of accident that has caused most death cases over the years?
3. For which area (inner town/out of town) has the least serious injury over the period?
4. What are the turning accident (one of the accident types) trends between the years 2013 to 2022 that fluctuated in terms of slightly injured occurrence?
5. How have the number of deaths, serious injuries, and slightly injured cases varied in recent (last 5) years due to driving accidents?


### Usage ######s

To do EDA (Exploratory data analysis), we have used python as programming language. the data stored in /data directory in CSV file, the main code store /src directory. and a detailed project explanation file stored in /doc directory.

Tools and Library Required

•	Jupyter Notebook
•	Python (python3)
•	Matplotlib (plotting library)
•	Pandas (DataFrame)
•	Seaborn (visualization)
•	Git (Version Control system)

### Necessary Guidelines to star t###

•	Make sure the two necessary tools installed properly in your machine the Python and Git, and make sure jupyter notebook run on the server.
    Source: Git [https://git-scm.com/], Python [https://www.python.org/]

•	Make sure All the mentioned libraries installed and imported  properly your Jupyter notebook
    [you can usen pip to install, eg, !pip install library name]

•	Clone the repository in your local machine
    https://gitup.uni-potsdam.de/uddin2/project_rse_824909.git

•	Then navigate to ‘src’ directory 
    % cd src  

•	Open the ipynb (Traffic_accident_RSE_project) file in jupyter notebook

	% jupyter notebook [After that server will open local server in locahost with a local address]

•	Finally RUN the cells to perform data analysis. In case of further details, you may refer to guidelines in markdown    file at jupyter notebook.
